# GatorChat

## Project description
GatorChat is a messaging application that caters exclusively to the University of Florida student community. The application offers a diverse selection of forum pages, including academic subjects such as classes and majors, as well as extracurricular activities such as sports and community events. By providing a space for students to participate in academic and social discussions relevant to their interests, GatorChat seeks to enrich their college experience and promote community engagement.

## Requirements for running and using GatorChat
We plan to deploy GatorChat soon. Meanwhile, to run GatorChat on your computer, you should follow these step-by-step instructions:

**Prerequisites**:
- Install Node.js, npm, and the Go programming language on your computer.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
- Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
- Run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/ty-hal/SWE-Project.git`

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
- Navigate to the `client` directory inside the project using the terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command: `npm install`
- This will install all the necessary dependencies required by the React app.

**Step 3: Start the React App**
- In the same terminal or command prompt, run the following command: `npm start`
- This will start the React app in development mode.
- Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the app.

**Step 4: Start the Go Server**
- Open **another** terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `server` directory inside the project.
- Run the following command: `go run main.go`
- This will start the Go server.

**Step 5: Use GatorChat**
- With both the React app and Go server running, you can now use GatorChat in your web browser.
- You can view any section and thread without an account, but you cannot interact with or modify any section or thread until you have registered for an account.
- To register for an account, navigate to the **Register** page through the navigation bar and fill in your information, including a UFL email address.
