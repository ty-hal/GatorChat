## User stories
### Frontend:
- As a **user**, I want to *view threads in a forum page* and enjoy the UI of browsing threads, so I will create an engaging and desirable template for how each thread previews.
- As a **user**, I want to *reply to threads and enjoy the messages UI*, so I will create an engaging and desirable template for each message.
- As a **user**, I want to *learn more about GatorChat*, so I will create an interactive display of important information about GatorChat on our FAQ page.
- As a **user**, I want to be able to *see my and other users' profile pictures*, so I will create an easy to implement and reuse component that displays a user's profile picture.
- As a **user**, I want to be able to *register an account*, so I will allow for the backend to receive important information about the user's registration form.
- As a **user**, I want to be able to *check if I entered my password to sign in correctly*, so I will create an visually appealing button to toggle password visibility.
- As a **user**, I want to be able to *edit my email, password, profile picture and name*, so I will create a settings page to allow users to change their information.

### Backend:
- As a **developer**, I want to *organize my REST API*, so I will split my endpoints into handlers to make my code more readable and easier to debug.
- As a **user**, I want to *secure my password*, so I will create a method to hash passwords stored in the database.
- As a **developer**, I want *all data organized, easily accessible, and identifiable*, so I will link tables through foreign keys and create distinguishable tables with related data.
- As a **developer**, I want to *easily access all data stored in all tables of the relational database*, so I will create separate, clear, and effective functions to perform queries that access/manipulate data.

## What issues your team planned to address
- Connect our React frontend to our Golang backend through a REST API.
- Create our database schema for user information.
- Integrate the database schema into structs in Golang to help organize our backend structure.
- Create functions that execute queries in order to easily access/manipulate the specified data.
- Create a working header and footer and sign in, registration, settings, terms and conditions, forgot user password, and FAQ pages in React.
- Create a working log in page using our REST API to determine if a user entered an email and password to an existing account.
- Create a working registration page using our REST API to create a user row in our database with relevant user information.
- Create a working settings page. Backend can be connected later.
 
## Which ones were successfully completed
The first four issues that we planned to address were successfully completed in this first sprint.

## Which ones didn't and why?
The last issue (a working registration page) was not completed yet due to the deadline approaching earlier than anticipated. We will have successfully completed this issue by the next sprint.
